  <description>
Adds an Ideology meme called Reward Motivation that rewards believers for completing quests and makes them unhappy when they fail or ignore quests. This meme is meant to make "all quests" runs more thematic and interesting.

Quests that do not require player input to accept are *not* considered.
Quests that the player allows to expire without accepting *are* considered.
Quests with negative diplomatic consequences are *not* considered.

=== Updates ===
10/30/2024: Fix bug that prevents selling colony for archonexus quest when there are unobtained relics
03/21/2024: Update to 1.5
